# Что говорят пользователь DPD


As the year is coming to an end I just wanted to write and thank you for all your work on DPD. It is now my No. 1 go-to dictionary, and I benefit from your work every day. At present I am translating the previously untranslated word-commentaries on the Jātaka verses. Wishing you all the very best for the coming year, and further progress in your work! Mettā

Your work is wonderful. I have been using it quite a bit as of lately as I am holding a seminar mostly based on Pali texts here in Berkeley and am saving soooo much time and energy thanks to you ... so much solved/resolved/pre-emptied ... how spoiled ... immense gratitude, sincerely.
